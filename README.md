# BYTES.NET
... a generic .net multi-target library (set) trying to ease rapid prototyping and software development

# Please Note
Originally written in VB.net, this project is currently migrating to C#, re-designing the entire code base and API. The 'src-1.x' folder contains the legacy (but stable) version for documentation and reference. Active development is done for the 2.x version only. 

Beginning with version 2.0, we will try to provide references and documentation available via https://bytes-dotnet.readme.io/docs. For specific questions please send us an e-mail to mail@hauptstadtbytes.de.
